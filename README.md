# Advice Owl

## About
Advice Owl is an advice column aggregator for mobile devices (currently only Android phones and tablets). 

## Technical
Advice Owl is built for mobile devices using the Apache Cordova (a.k.a. PhoneGap) framework. It reads the RSS feeds of popular advice columns, using jGFeed - an abstraction layer on top of Google Feeds API - to process all the data in JSON on the client side. It uses jQuery and jQuery Mobile, to help make JavaScript a pleasure to code with.

Thanks to all the Open Source developers who contributed to the libraries that made this project possible!
