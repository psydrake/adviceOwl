# Advice Owl

## About
Advice Owl is an advice column aggregator for mobile devices (currently Android based phones and tablets, including the Kindle Fire). 

## Technical
Advice Owl is built for mobile devices using the Apache Cordova (a.k.a. PhoneGap) framework. It reads the RSS feeds of popular advice columns, using jGFeed - an abstraction layer on top of Google Feeds API - to process all the data in JSON on the client side. It uses jQuery and jQuery Mobile, to help make coding with JavaScript a pleasure.

Thanks to all the Open Source developers who contributed to the libraries that made this project possible!
